# Customized 404 pages

If the user arrives to a page that does not exist, the erver will show a `404 Not Found` error.

In some systems, such as GitHub pages, we can customize the content of the `404` -page by creating a file called `404.html`.

mdBook automatically generates one for us, but if we create a file called `404.md` in our source directory, then we can fully
control the content of this page. See [the 404 page of this book](./404.md).

It does **not** need to be listed in the `SUMMARY.md` file.
