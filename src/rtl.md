# Right to left languages (Hebrew, Arabic, Farsi)

Most languages are written from left to right (LTR), but if you are in the lucky situation that your language is written from Right to Left (RTL), don't worry. mdBook can work for you.

By setting the `language` or by setting the text-direction` fields in the `book` section the book will be rendered from right o left.


```
[book]
text-direction = "rtl"
language = "he"
```

If you'd like to see and example you can take a look at the [Hebrew Code Maven](https://he.code-maven.com/) or the [Persian translation](https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/fa/) of the [Comprehensive Rust](https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/)  book.
