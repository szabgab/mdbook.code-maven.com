# Getting started with mdBook

If you'd like to write a book or build a web site utilizing mdBook, the first thing you need is to install the mdBook command line tool.

You can do so by downloading the pre-built executable from the [GitHub release pages](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/releases) or if you have the Rust compiler installed on you computer you
can also build mdBook yourself by runnng

```
cargo install mdbook
```


Once you have `mdbook` on you computer create a new folder that will hold the book, open your cmd window or terminal in that folder and run

```
mdbook init
```

Anwer the questions. That will create the skeleton of a book.
