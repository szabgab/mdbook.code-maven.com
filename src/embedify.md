# Preprocessing special tags with Embedify

The [embedify preprocessor](https://github.com/MR-Addict/mdbook-embedify) for mdBooks allows you to extend your book in number of ways.
In order to use it you need to install the preprocessor and add the following line to the `book.toml` file:


```toml
[preprocessor.embedify]
```

On the next few pages we'll see examples for uses, but you should probably also check out the [user documentation](https://mr-addict.github.io/mdbook-embedify/).
